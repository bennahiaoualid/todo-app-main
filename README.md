## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build a todo app that allows users to create, manage, and filter tasks.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new tasks to the list
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks from the list
- Filter tasks by all, active, and completed
- Clear all completed tasks
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Store the state of the app in the browser's local storage

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to build a functional todo app that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. I practiced working with DOM manipulation, handling user interactions, and persisting data in the browser's local storage. Additionally, I gained experience in creating responsive layouts, implementing filter functionality, and providing a seamless user experience with light and dark mode toggling.

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I plan to continue enhancing my skills in JavaScript, focusing on improving code organization, modularization, and error handling. I also aim to explore more advanced JavaScript concepts like working with APIs and implementing more complex user interactions. Additionally, I will continue to improve my responsive web design skills and accessibility practices.
